  abstract = {In this second part of a two part exploration of dynamic behavior observed in wildland fires, time scales differentiating convective and radiative heat transfer is further explored. Scaling laws for the two different types of heat transfer considered: Radiation-driven fire spread, and convectiondriven fire spread, which can both occur during wildland fires. A new interpretation of the inertial forces introduced a downstream, time-dependent frequency, ω, which captures the dynamic, vortex shedding behavior of flames due to the unstable nature of the turbulent flow created in the wake of the fire. Excelsior and paper strip experiments suggest wildland fire is a falls into the convection-driven spread regime.},

An experimental study was performed to quantify the decomposition kinetics, heat of decomposition for pyrolysis, and the heat of combustion of the evolved pyrolysis gases and char oxidation. Parameters were determined using data from a simultaneous TGA / DSC as well as the microscale combustion calorimeter. From TGA data, a double independent reaction kinetic model was sufficient to describe the decomposition of cardboard due to a softened hemicellulose peak. The heat of combustion of pyrolysis gases was a factor of two less than that of the char. However, due to the lower mass loss rate of char, the heat release rate due to the char was less than half of that associated with the evolved pyrolysis gases.},

The modelling capability is based on a general-purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) library called OpenFOAM and an in-house Lagrangian particle model that treats drying, thermal pyrolysis, oxidative pyrolysis and char oxidation using a one-dimensional porous medium formulation that allows descriptions of thermal degradation processes occurring during both flaming and smoldering combustion.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the ignition and pyrolysis of natural vegetation fuel is crucial in modeling the rate of spread of wildland fires. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the burning process of biomass fuel particles under oscillatory heat flux conditions; the oscillations are studied as a model to represent flapping flames or fluctuations in the irradiation above natural vegetation beds. We consider two separate cases corresponding to unsteady radiative or convective heating, with oscillations at different fre­ quencies, and we consider charring (constant-volume) and non-charring (shrinking), elongated and squareshaped, solid fuel particles of 1 mm and 10 mm half-size. The results of the numerical simulations suggest that the particles experience a quasi-linear response in the case of fluctuating irradiation or fluctuating local gas temperature; this linear response means that the effects of oscillations can essentially be ignored. However, a non-linear response is obtained in the case of unsteady convective heating, when the local gas velocity fluctuates in phase with the local gas temperature; this non-linear response leads to a net effect of the oscillations in the form of an augmented heat transfer, higher temperatures, higher values of the fuel mass loss rate, and shorter burnout times.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model of the pyrolysis of wet particles of wood is presented. The model integrates: (i) a conventional description of the physical and chemical phenomena involved in the pyrolysis pf dry particles of wood, and (ii) a simplified drying model. The dry-pyrolysis model assumes a complex reaction scheme independently determined. The most important parameters were experimentally measured, including the thermal conductivities and all the kinetic parameters; other parameters were taken as average values from the literature. The drying model neglects bound-water diffusion, air/vapour diffusion and pressure gradients inside the solid. Free-water movement is not described. Drying is therefore controlled by heat supply. These assumptions restrict the model validity range to: (a) temperatures higher than 15O”C, (b) initial moisture content below the free-water continuity point (-45\%), and (c) sample dimension in the wood longitudinal direction not much greater than the dimensions in the transversa1 directions. The combined wet pyrolysis model has been experimentally validated in the simulation of: (i) drying of pine wood cylinders of variable diameter above 15O”C, and (ii) pyrolysis of dry and wet cylinders of pine wood of variable diameter between 300 and 800°C. No parameter optimization was required.},

This is mainly due to the large number of particles that have to be considered. In this work different solution methods for solving a biomass pyrolysis particle model are presented. The computational time that each method requires is compared, taking into account typical process parameters and time step sizes of fixed-bed and fluidized-bed reactors. It can be concluded that, if the boundary conditions of the particle model are constant, a multi-step ODEs solver – the backward differencing formulas method – is the fastest. However, when coupling a particle model to a reactor model, these boundary conditions will change over time and the particle model should provide a solution each time step of the reactor model, usually in the order of magnitude of milliseconds. In this situation the ODEs solvers require a high computational time due to it initialization every time step and the fastest method is a novel iterative, fractional-step algorithm presented in this study, where each phenomenon is solved with an implicit, semi-implicit or explicit method depending on its characteristic time.},

The numerical model is used to examine the impact of shrinkage on particle size, pyrolysis time, product yields, speciÿc heat capacity and Biot number considering cylindrical geometry. Finite di erence pure implicit scheme utilizing tri-diagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA) is employed for solving heat transfer model equation. Runge–Kutta fourth-order method is used for chemical kinetics model equations. Simulations are carried out for radius ranging from 0.0000125 to 0:05 m, temperature ranging from 303 to 900 K and shrinkage factors ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The results obtained using the model used in the present study are in excellent agreement with many experimental studies, much better than the agreement with the earlier models reported in the literature. Shrinkage a ects both the pyrolysis time and the product yield in thermally thick regime. However, it is found that shrinkage has negligible a ect on pyrolysis in the thermally thin regime. The impact of shrinkage re ects on pyrolysis in several ways. It includes reduction of the residence time of gases within the particle, cooling of the char layer due to higher mass ux rates of pyrolysis products and thinning the pyrolysis reaction region.},

  abstract = {Many phenomena affects devolatilization of relatively large wood particles, e.g. wood pellets and logs, including mass and heat transfer, chemical reactions and physical transformation such as shrinkage. Many studies investigated the importance of these phenomena through detailed mathematical models at particle scale, but the models need to be simplified at a certain degree to be implemented into large-scale simulation for gasifiers and boilers. This paper first presents how each physical and chemical parameter should be modelled for wood logs (low density and anisotropic) and wood pellets (high density and isotropic) through parametric studies with a detailed particle simulation. They required different sub-models for effective thermal conductivity and heat of reactions due to the difference in isotropy of particles between pellets and logs. Then, we demonstrated that a constitutive equation, i.e. analytical solution of the shrinking core model, is sufficient to express devolatilization rate of thermally-thick particles at the temperature of 1173 K with proper sub-models of physical and chemical parameters. The constitutive equation agreed better with experimental data of wood log than wood pellets, mainly because of the error caused during the consideration of the effect of convective cooling of char layer on thermal conductivity. Both detailed and simplified particle models were validated with the experimental data in an isothermal macro thermogravimeter allowing devolatilization of large particles. Ó 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report a significant shift in the non-stationary relationship linking fire weather conditions and fire intensity measured in terms of CO               2               emissions released during biomass burning across a latitudinal gradient of European IPCC regions. The reported trends indicate that global warming is possibly inducing an incipient change on regional fire dynamics towards increased fire impacts in Europe, suggesting that emerging risks posed by exceptional fire-weather danger conditions may progressively exceed current wildfire suppression capabilities in the next decades and impact forest carbon sinks.},

  abstract = {Fire-spread was measured on 121 grass fires in a 2500 ha experimental site in the Northern Territory, Australia. Selected plots were harvested to alter the height, load and bulk density of the fuel-bed. Fires were lit from a line and allowed to travel up to 400 m down-wind. Fire-spread was correlated with fuel, weather and fireshape variables using multiple regression techniques. Wind speed had most effect on fire-spread.  The influence of the other variables was examined after a model for wind speed and moisture content had been fitted. Fuel load did not influence fire-spread. Fires in natural swards burnt 18\% faster than fires in cut grass, but this increase could not be fully explained by changes in the height or bulk density of the fuel bed. Grass type characterised either by species group or by surface-area-to-volume ratio of the fuel particle, did not appear to significantly influence fire-spread. Differences in spread rates between the two grasses were attributed to differences in grass curing. The influence of grass curing appeared to be less than indicated by published models. Models of fire-spread in grasslands currently in use need to be revised. Ignition line length was a significant variable influencing fire-spread and this must be taken into consideration when using experimental fires to validate theoretical models or develop empirical models from field observations.},

In the complete absence of free convection, the theoretical expression of Nakai and Okazaki may be more accurate for RePr {$<$} 0.2. The correlating equation is based on theoretical results for the effect of Pr in the laminar boundary layer, and on both theoretical and experimental results for the effect of Re. The process of correlation reveals the need for theoretical results for the effect of Pr in the region of the wake. Additional experimental data for the effect of Pr at small Pe and for the effect of Re during the transition in the point of separation are also needed.},

In this paper we present an updated comprehensive pyrolysis model including chemical reactions and transport of heat and species, implemented independently in two different software environments. Results of the model are compared to experimental results of three independent sets of centimeter-scale experiments. Temperatures, mass losses, and rate of production of several gaseous and light tar species are included in the comparisons. Predictions and experiments agree qualitatively and in most cases have reasonable quantitative agreement. We also report comparisons of model predictions to literature data obtained in other regimes (thermogravimetric analysis and homogeneous tar cracking) in order to demonstrate that predictive capabilities of the model have not been compromised by the modifications presented here.},

  abstract = {Single particle combustion behaviours of coal-biomass fuel mixtures are studied. Different biomass i.e. sawdust, wood and rice husk is blended with locally available low grade coal to carry out the experimental investigation. The combustion of solid fuel consists of flaming combustion and char combustion. Rice husk showed higher flaming time and char glowing time because of higher ash and particle density. The burning time of coal-rice husk mixture fuel sample is higher compared to other samples due to the combine effect of particle density and ash content of the fuel samples. Ignition mass flux of saw dust is higher compared to rice husk and wood fuel particles because of the presence of higher volatiles in sawdust. The diameter index for flaming combustion, char combustion are 1.13 to 0.47 and 0.63 to 1.23 respectively for 0\%e40\% coal in coal/wood fuel mixtures. It is observed that with the increases in surface area/volume ratio, flaming and char combustion decreases due to reduction in effective surface area of the particle for combustion. This study concludes that particle size or surface area/volume together with particle density are the primary controlling parameter for better conversion of fuel mixtures in any cocombustion system.},

  abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to extend an existing biomass characterization method, which, on the basis of the elemental carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen composition, derives the biochemical composition, in terms of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Because of their elemental composition, several biomasses cannot be characterized by a feasible mixture of these reference components. This limitation is removed by accounting for the presence of a couple of new lumped species, representing hydrophobic and hydrophilic extractives. This extended characterization method allows one to enlarge its range of validity significantly, thus covering most of the biomass samples. The accuracy of the extended method is validated by comparing experimental data on structural or biochemical composition with model predictions. The multistep kinetic scheme of biomass pyrolysis is then extended to the new reference species, on the basis of comparisons with TGA experiments on triglyceride and tannin pyrolysis. The new pyrolysis model is proved to be fully consistent with the previous one, already widely validated under different conditions. Several comparisons of pyrolysis of biomass samples, outside the applicability range of the original method, validate the proposed extension. Moreover, the results show that this predictive model is not very sensitive to the different degrees of freedom of the new biomass characterization approach.},

Expressions for the burn rates, distribution profiles of temperature, and positions of the drying, pyrolysis, and smoldering fronts are obtained in terms of the smolder temperatures. An appropriate smolder transfer number is defined. Heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation inside the porous matrix of the log is considered, as are convection and radiation around the log and inside the boundary layer adjacent to the smoldering end. Solutions for the problem without circumferential heat losses and for a single front of drying and pyrolysis are also presented. The effects of variations of several parameters, such as moisture content, log diameter, pyrolysis temperature, heat of char oxidation, heat of pyrolysis, porosity, fuel density, and char density, are evaluated. The theoretical burning rates are in good agreement with available experimental data.},

  abstract = {This review reports the state of the art in modeling chemical and physical processes of wood and biomass pyrolysis. Chemical kinetics are critically discussed in relation to primary reactions, described by one- and multi-component (or one- and multi-stage) mechanisms, and secondary reactions of tar cracking and polymerization. A mention is also made of distributed activation energy models and detailed mechanisms which try to take into account the formation of single gaseous or liquid (tar) species. Different approaches used in the transport models are presented at both the level of single particle and reactor, together with the main achievements of numerical simulations. Finally, critical issues which require further investigation are indicated.},

  abstract = {A wet wood pyrolysis model was developed involving the combined influence of moisture, char oxidation, flame radiation and chemical reaction kinetics. Especially instead of multiple parallel reactions, a simple one-step nth-order Arrhenius expression for dry wood pyrolysis was combined with moisture drying reaction, which aimed at reducing the difficulty of obtaining kinetic and thermophysical parameters of intermediate solids. Code validation shows that the predicted surface temperature and total solid conversion ratio agree well with Shen et al.’s measured values in cone calorimeter under air atmosphere. The mass fluxes of water vapor and pyrolysate are analyzed as a function of wet wood thickness under various external radiation heat fluxes. The thickness has no effect on the maximum mass flux of vapor. The thickness of 8 mm is found to be the critical value with two peaks appearing simultaneously at pyrolysate mass flux profiles under 40 kW mÀ2. For the cases with two peaks of pyrolysate mass flux, the thickness has little effect on the time and value at the first peak of pyrolysate. However, those at second peak vary obviously with thickness. The fitting correlations of vapor duration and second pyrolysate flux peak time were also obtained.},

Flames in the span-wise direction appeared as a regular series of peaks-and-troughs that scaled directly with flame length. Flame structure in the stream-wise direction fluctuated with the forward advection of coherent parcels that originated near the rear edge of the flame zone. Thermocouples arranged longitudinally in the fuel beds revealed the frequency of these temperature fluctuations decreased with flame length but increased with wind speed. The downstream extent of these fluctuations scaled with Froude number and flame zone depth. These behaviors are remarkably similar to those of boundary layers, suggesting a dominant role for buoyancy in determining wildland fire spread.},

  abstract = {Wildland fires have an irreplaceable role in sustaining many of our forests, shrublands and grasslands. They can be used as controlled burns or occur as free-burning wildfires, and can sometimes be dangerous and destructive to fauna, human communities and natural resources. Through scientific understanding of their behaviour, we can develop the tools to reliably use and manage fires across landscapes in ways that are compatible with the constraints of modern society while benefiting the ecosystems.  The science of wildland fire is incomplete, however. Even the simplest fire behaviours – how fast they spread, how long they burn and how large they get – arise from a dynamical system of physical processes interacting in unexplored ways with heterogeneous biological, ecological and meteorological factors across many scales of time and space. The physics of heat transfer, combustion and ignition, for example, operate in all fires at millimetre and millisecond scales but wildfires can become conflagrations that burn for months and exceed millions of hectares.  Wildland Fire Behaviour: Dynamics, Principles and Processes examines what is known and unknown about wildfire behaviours. The authors introduce fire as a dynamical system along with traditional steady-state concepts. They then break down the system into its primary physical components, describe how they depend upon environmental factors, and explore system dynamics by constructing and exercising a nonlinear model. The limits of modelling and knowledge are discussed throughout but emphasised by review of large fire behaviours. Advancing knowledge of fire behaviours will require a multidisciplinary approach and rely on quality measurements from experimental research, as covered in the final chapters.},

It includes the description of all the relevant heat and mass transfer phenomena and assumes that the thermally controlled drying, the finite-rate kinetics pyrolysis, and the mixed kinetic-diffusive controlled combustion take place at infinitely thin fronts. The solution, based on the integral method, shows that apart from short initial and final transients, an ablation regime is established given high external heat fluxes and/or high moisture contents, high wood density and thermal conductivity, and low char density. Drying, pyrolysis, and combustion take place simultaneously along a constant-thickness layer that propagates at a constant rate (the same for the three fronts) towards the cold sample side. Good quantitative agreement is obtained between model predictions and measurements. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

For over a decade he has examined written and visual records of the Australian landscape. He has uncovered an extraordinarily complex system of land management using fire, the life cycles of native plants, and the natural flow of water to ensure plentiful wildlife and plant foods throughout the year. We know Aboriginal people spent far less time and effort than Europeans in securing food and shelter ... .

  abstract = {Combustion is the most commonly used technology to produce energy from biomass; nevertheless, there are still thermal efficiency problems in current biomass combustion furnaces and a lack of knowledge about the properties of residual biomasses that could be used as fuels. Aiming to contribute to knowledge of the potential of residual biomass for energy generation, this work reports on the implementation of a 2D computational model to study the combustion performance of several solid biomass fuels, and its application in the analysis of Lippia origanoides bagasse combustion. The model uses an Eulerian–Lagrangian approach; in the continuous phase, governing equations are solved, and in the dispersed phase, particles are tracked and the mass, momentum, species and energy transfer between the phases are calculated. The model was validated against experimental data from a combustor fueled by three biomasses: wood pellets, olive stone and almond shell. The results show deviations of less than 13\%, with few exceptions, which indicates a good degree of agreement with experimental measurements compared with those reported by other studies on the subject.

  abstract = {This work aims presenting a new computational framework (bioSMOKE) for modeling the thermochemical conversion of anisotropic biomass particles. It allows for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, applied to porous media, providing a better insight into the relative role of transport phenomena and chemical kinetics. The code is embedded within the OpenFOAMÒ framework and allows managing the spatial discretization of the governing equations on arbitrary geometries. One of the original aspects of this work is represented by the development of a comprehensive approach to model the anisotropic particle shrinking during the thermal decomposition. It is based on the evaluation of a shrinking wave front which progressively evolves during the transient and allows for handling arbitrary multi-dimensional particle deformations due to anisotropy and/or non-uniform boundary conditions. Despite the outstanding importance of this topic, only few models are available in the literature, usually based on empirical correlations or fitting parameters. The code has been validated against comparisons with experimental data of particle pyrolysis in different ranges of operative conditions. Three different geometries were analyzed (sphere, cylinder and slab), to show the reliability and the capability of bioSMOKE in handling particle shrinking. The model turns out to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental data and it is able to properly predict the temperature history of the particle, the mass/volume loss, as well as the evolution of the major species released during the pyrolysis. The deep understanding of the main chemical/physical phenomena occurring at the particle scale is an essential step toward the multiscale-based analysis of thermochemical processes involving solid particles. In view of this, the proposed approach results being extremely useful for a rational modeling at the reactor scale.},

In the present work a new eddy viscosity model is presented which alleviates many of these drawbacks. The model coefficient is computed dynamically as the calculation progresses rather than input a\hphantom{,}priori. The model is based on an algebraic identity between the subgrid-scale stresses at two different filtered levels and the resolved turbulent stresses. The subgrid-scale stresses obtained using the proposed model vanish in laminar flow and at a solid boundary, and have the correct asymptotic behavior in the near-wall region of a turbulent boundary layer. The results of large-eddy simulations of transitional and turbulent channel flow that use the proposed model are in good agreement with the direct simulation data.},

The investigated models were variations of oxidation and gasification mechanisms. Oxidation mechanisms overestimated the char consumption and the overall HRR. The gasification mechanism under estimated the char consumption and the overall HRR from the wood sample. The best performance was obtained from a combined oxidation-gasification model. The model assumes parallel partial oxidation by oxygen and gasification by carbon dioxide forming carbon monoxide in the gas phase.},

An updated survey of published mathematical reactor models for biomass and waste gasification in FB is presented. The overall conclusion is that most of the FB biomass gasification models fit reasonably well experiments selected for validation, despite the various formulations and input data.

The pyrolysis of three Scandinavian wood species (birch, pine, pineroot and spruce); five different celluloses, and hemicellulose and lignin isolated from birch and spruce have been studied by thermogravimetry. The celluloses exhibited sharp, single DTG curves which could be well described by a single first order reaction model. The kinetic analysis gave activation energies between 210 and 280 kj/mole for all the celluloses. The thermograms of the wood species revealed different weight loss characteristics which can be attributed to their different chemical composition. In the kinetic analysis, a model of independent parallel reactions was successfully used to describe the thermal degradation. The main advantage of this modeling approach is that the in situ decomposition of cellulose in wood can be studied. A mean activation energy of 260 kJ/mole with a standard deviation ±16 kJ/mole was calculated.},

  abstract = {Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel and is widely used as an energy source for combustion and gasification. Both experimental methods and computational tools are required for the development of new advanced, innovative clean coal technologies and systems. In particular, 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can provide detailed local and global information on the interaction of fluid dynamics, mixing, and heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions even for complex systems such as combustors, gasifiers, or chemical re­ actors. The predictive capabilities of CFD simulations depend directly on appropriate models and their mutual interactions. The current state of modeling is reviewed in this paper and the need for further improvements of both individual models and their respective coupling is addressed. In addition, to evaluate and validate the models and their interactions, systems with increasing complexity and well-defined boundary and operating conditions are required that can provide suitable experimental data. A number of reference burners and com­ bustors, developed especially at universities and research institutions, are also presented and recent simulation data for these systems is reviewed.},

  abstract = {The fuel packing ratio (β) significantly influences the fire spread in discrete fuels; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study performed experiments using laser-cut cardboards with different packing ratios to explore the heat transfer in fire spread. We identify two distinct spread behaviors under varying packing ratios. Heat flux data indicate that radiation controls the surface heat transfer (denoting the heat transfer received by the fuel bed surface) far from the flame, while convective heating plays a considerable part sur­ rounding the flame. The surface heat transfer is enhanced under lower packing ratios (Stage 1) and is responsible for the increase of the rate of spread (ROS) in this stage. Under higher packing ratios (Stage 2), the surface heat transfer does not vary significantly, and the surface radiation transfers more energy to fuels than surface con­ vection. ROS reduction in Stage 2 is attributed mainly to the internal heat transfer (denoting the heat transfer received by the sides of the fuel particles) dominated by radiation. The dense fuel bed impedes the response of inbed fuel to internal heat transfer, which, however, does not significantly influence the time integral of the in­ ternal total and radiant heat fluxes. Besides, the flame residence time almost linearly increases with the packing ratio when the flame can spread.},

  abstract = {Combining a volume reaction model and front reaction approximation is proposed to simulate the combustion of a large biomass particle. Two intraparticle processes—drying and char oxidation—are simplified as front reaction because they are transport controlled. The other intraparticle process—pyrolysis—is described as the volume reaction because it is controlled by both heat transfer and kinetics. A new numerical method based on the basic mechanism of the process is applied to mitigate oscillations of the solution of the front reactions. To compare the calculation results with the experimental results presented in the literature, combustion of cubic wood particles between 5 and 25 mm is chosen to test the new method. Drying, pyrolysis, char oxidation, vapor condensation, shrinkage of the process, heat transfer via conduction, diffusion, convection, radiation and mass transfer via diffusion, and convection inside particle are taken into account. Finite volumes attached to solid materials are used to discretize the domain and explicit method with variable time step is used to calculate the process. A program was written and the calculation showed that the conversion of a particle is almost independent of computational mesh from 10 cells on. However there is significant instability in the mass loss rate curve when the number of cells is less than 20. Predictions for different particle sizes, furnace temperatures and moisture contents were compared with measurements and they agree reasonably well. The results highlight the significance of pyrolysis kinetics on prediction. Thus, the front reaction model of pyrolysis assuming a constant reaction temperature of 773 K is sometimes inadequate. The proposed method also showed that moisture content and pyrolysis reactivity significantly affect the thickness of devolatilizing fuel.},

  abstract = {Combustion of fixed fuel beds in grate furnaces is common within production of heat and power from solid fuels. Available theoretical and experimental experience provides a solid base of knowledge on how a conversion model of a fuel bed, using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), needs to be structured and solved. Most existing models, however, handle the conversion in one single dimension of constant bed properties; when observing a burning fuel bed in a grate furnace it becomes apparent that the fuel bed is neither homogeneous nor uni-dimensional. In this study, a two-dimensional model of the combustion of fixed fuel beds has been developed for the purpose of studying the influence of heterogeneous fuel-bed properties on the conversion. In the model, the available experience from fuel-bed modelling by means of the sub-models for fixed-bed conversion was structured into a fluid-flow scale and into a fuel-particle scale, in which new formulations describing the shrinkage of the fuel bed on a multi-particle scale was introduced. Both available and new sub-models were introduced into a pre-existing CFD-platform, in which the framework for simulating fluid flow in porous media was used to solve also the conversion related processes acting within the particle scales as well as within the multi-particle scales. The complete model was validated with good correspondence between available measurements of temperature and species concentration in a wood-char combustor. In addition, the modelled shrinkage was found to well describe the observed shrinkage of the fuel bed in a combustion experiment. Results of model simulations by using heterogeneous bed porosity show that a porous passage through the bed risks causing channelling in the fuel bed – a phenomenon common in modern grate furnaces and suspected to cause increased emissions of nitric oxides and unburned carbon compounds. The channelling tendency could, however, to a large extent be reduced by grates of higher flow resistance. The natural porosity increase attributable to the packing of particles onto a wall was shown to concentrate combustion disturbances close to the surface of the grate. Thus, larger changes in the porosity than caused by natural fuel packing against a wall are needed to give rise to channels that emerge through the fuel bed.},

There was a peak flame height after which the flame returned to steady height approximately equal to the value before the ignition of the particle board and flame heights with inert panels. Flames did not spread to the top of the panel with increased experiment duration. Char height and area were found to increase with heat-release rate but were not affected significantly by experiment duration.

  abstract = {This modeling study examines the effect of particle morphology on devolatilization of biomass particles at conditions relevant for suspension firing. A model, which can calculate devolatilization times and particle temperatures for both spherical and cylindrical particles of a wide size range is established, and modeling predictions are compared to experimental data from literature with good consistency. The model accounts for the influence of aspect ratio and allows for biomass particles to be modeled as cylinders; a more accurate representation than the classical spherical approach. If a spherical approach is desirable due to limitations in computational costs, it is found to be more accurate to retain the diameter of the cylindrical biomass particle in the calculations rather than to adjust the radius to create a sphere with the same volume as the original particle. An analysis of the relative effect on devolatilization time of relevant physical parameters for three particle sizes (dp = 79 μm, 0.8 mm, and 3.1 mm) is presented, evaluating both kinetic and heat transfer limitations. In general, model results show that the time for full devolatilization varies with more than two orders of magnitude in the particle size range (dp = 0.08–3 mm) relevant for suspension firing. For the relevant gas temperature (Tg = 1300–1900 K) and density (ρ = 400–1000 kg/m3) intervals, the devolatilization times approximately doubles within both interval ranges. Variations in moisture content primarily influence the time for onset of devolatilization, which may affect flame stability in suspension fired boilers.},

Volatile yields of the 45−75 μm sawdust were measured and are believed to be similar to those that would occur in an industrial entrained-flow combustor or gasifier. A refractory tar yield near 1.5 wt \% (dry, ash-free) was measured. A high percentage of the fully pyrolyzed sawdust char was spherical, having lost the original sawdust structure. It is suggested that the morphology of sawdust char may continue to change after complete mass release from pyrolysis. Sawdust pyrolysis was modeled using the chemical percolation devolatilization (CPD) model assuming that biomass pyrolysis occurs as a weighted average of its individual components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). Thermal cracking of tar into light gas was included using a first-order kinetic model from the literature. The devolatilization yields of three kinds of sawdust from three different reactors (flat-flame burner, drop-tube, and thermogravimetric analyzer) were accurately predicted.},

  abstract = {A fact often overlooked is that large-scale wildfires, although occurring infrequently, are responsible for the overwhelming majority of fire-related suppression costs, economic losses, and natural resources damages. Fortunately, the increasingly severe problems of large-scale wildfires worldwide have been receiving ever-growing academic attention. The high-intensity burning behaviors in wildfires stem from the significant interaction of combustion with heat transfer and atmospheric flow under complicated fuel, meteorology, and topography conditions. Therefore, mitigating measures against large-scale wildfire disasters have grown into a challenging research focus for combustion scientists. Research over the past century has resulted in incrementally enhanced insights into the mechanisms of combustion dynamics underlying the various erratic behaviors in large-scale wildfires, with theories and models of fire accelerations developed and validated. These advances are expected to improve the efficacy of large-scale wildfire predictions significantly. Nevertheless, the physical interpretation of the acceleration of large-scale wildfires is far from adequate and complete. This paper intends not to make a comprehensive review of the entire wildfire research field, but to depict an overall pattern of the essential factors that lead an initial small-scale spreading flame to a large-scale wildfire beyond control. It is outlined that the complicated transformation of fuel preheating mechanisms determines the growth of surface fire spread, while varied large-size flame fronts and unique spread modes induced in specific fire environments play an essential role in fire spread acceleration. Additionally, multiple fires burning and merging often act as crucial steps for accelerating surface fire spread, generating large-size flames, and triggering unique spread modes. These major potential factors strike the energy balance of a low-intensity wildfire and push it to a high-intensity state. Several issues regarding intensely burning behaviors in largescale wildfires are selected for in-depth discussions, for which an overview of the progress and challenges in research is presented. It is concluded that the fundamental exploration targeted at developing application tools capable of dealing with large-scale wildfires remains at its early stages. Opportunities for innovation are abundant, yet systematic and long-term research programs are required.},

  abstract = {The conversion of woody biomass is studied by means of a layer-based model for thermally-thick biomass particles (Thunman et al. 2002, Ström et al. 2013). The model implementation is successfully validated against experiments that study particle conversion in a drop tube reactor. After this validation step, this work focuses on the well-known problem of grid dependence of two-phase numerical simulations using the standard Euler–Lagrange (EL) framework. This issue is addressed and quantified by comparing EL data that models the particle boundary layers to corresponding simulations which fully resolve these boundary layers (fully-resolved, FR, simulations). A comparison methodology for the conceptually different FR and EL approaches by extracting the heat transfer coefficient from the detailed FR simulations is proposed and confirms that the EL results are strongly grid-dependent. This issue is overcome by applying a set of coarse-graining methods for the EL framework. Two coarse-graining methods are evaluated, a previously suggested diffusion-based method (DBM) and a new approach based on moving averages referred to as MAM. It is shown that both DBM and MAM can successfully recover the detailed FR data for pure particle heating for a case where the grid size is half the particle diameter, i.e. when the standard EL method fails. Both coarse-graining methods also give improved results for an EL simulation that considers the more complex combined physics of particle heating, drying and devolatilisation, given that the CG model parameters that scale the corresponding CG interaction volumes are sufficiently large. Based on the available FR data, recommended model parameter ranges for DBM and MAM are provided as a function of normalised boundary layer thickness. The novel MAM approach is shown to be significantly more efficient than the DBM and therefore suitable for future EL simulations with multiple particles.},

  author = {Mehrabian, Ramin and Stangl, Stefan and Scharler, Robert and Obernberger, Ingwald},
  date = {2011},
  abstract = {A 3D CFD model for biomass packed bed combustion has been developed at BIOENERGY 2020+ in co-operation with BIOS BIOENERGIESYSTEME and KWB in a previous work [1]. It consists of an Euler-Granular model for hydrodynamics of gas-particle multiphase flow and a thermally thin particle model for combustion of biomass particles. In this paper, this model has been improved by the implementation of a layer model for thermally thick particles. The new packed bed model provides the advantages of considering the intra-particle species and temperature gradients and, accordingly, allows for parallel progress of the thermal conversion sub-processes. Moreover, the layer model considers a more realistic shape for biomass particles, e.g. cylinders. Enhanced models for pyrolysis and char oxidation are applied and char gasification reactions are included. Additionally, the products of char oxidation are CO and CO2, whereas the ratio between these species changes depending on the particle temperature. The simulation of a small-scale underfeed stoker furnace has been successfully performed by the application of the new packed bed combustion model. The positions of the drying, pyrolysis and char burnout zones in the fuel bed as well as the temperature distribution among the particles seem to be plausible and could be confirmed by observations. Furthermore, a good qualitative agreement concerning the flue gas temperatures measured by thermocouples at different positions in the combustion chamber and CO emissions measured at boiler outlet could be achieved.},

  abstract = {Fossil fuels, including coal, continue to dominate global energy consumption despite green initiatives. Recent disruptions in coal trade flows have led to increased usage in Europe. While efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources are expected to reduce coal demand, it is unlikely that coal usage will cease in the near future. Studying coal combustion is therefore crucial due to its significant environmental impact and carbon dioxide emissions. This work aims to enhance the understanding and optimization of coal combustion by developing an advanced large eddy simulation (LES) framework that integrates flamelet-based tabulation strategies within an Euler-Lagrange framework. This approach has the potential for wider applicability, extending beyond coal to other solid fuels such as iron. The findings of the published studies have made significant progress in this field. The investigations cover various flame setups, exploring coal combustion under different conditions. Through detailed LES and comparisons with experimental data, the studies demonstrate improved predictions of combustion characteristics, temperature profiles, species concentrations, and pollutant emissions. The first study focuses on a laboratory-scale coal jet flame, employing a four-dimensional flamelet/progress variable (FPV) approach, considering two mixture fractions for the hydrogen pilot and volatiles. The study highlights the importance of accounting for experimental artifacts and probe effects to improve the accuracy of simulations. It reveals significant deviations of up to 50 \% in the results due to the probing effect. This finding emphasizes the need to consider and correct for these effects when conducting numerical simulations of coal combustion. The second study investigates the co-firing of coal and ammonia, focusing on the same laboratoryscale coal jet flame. In this study, a five-dimensional three-mixture fraction FPV approach is used, additionally considering a mixture fraction for ammonia and developing a specific reaction mechanism for ammonia co-firing. The simulations show reasonable agreement with experimental data, improving predictions of OH and NH reaction zone locations. The third study examines a semi-industrial scale coal furnace with a low-NOx burner, using a four-dimensional FPV approach, considering two mixture fractions to account for volatile gases and char burnout to predict NOx emissions and understand formation mechanisms. The simulations show an overall good agreement with experimental observations, with the solution of an additional transport equation for NO proving to be superior in improving the prediction of forward- and backward reactions of NO within the furnace. These published papers advance our understanding of coal combustion dynamics, pollutant formation, and emission reduction strategies. The flamelet-based tabulation techniques and detailed reaction mechanisms employed in the studies enhance prediction accuracy and provide valuable insights into complex coal combustion processes.},

  abstract = {This paper is an overview of the physical mechanisms and length scales governing the propagation of wildfires. One of the objectives is to identify the physical and mathematical constraints in the modelling of wildfires when using a ‘‘fully’’ physical approach. The literature highlights two regimes in the propagation of surface fires, i.e. wind-driven fires and plume-dominated fires, which are governed by radiation and convective heat transfer, respectively. This division leads to the identification of two governing length scales: the extinction length characterising the absorption of radiation by vegetation, and the integral turbulent length scale characterising the interaction between wind and canopy. Some numerical results published during the last decade using a fully physical approach are presented and discussed with a focus on the models FIRESTAR, FIRELES, FIRETEC and WFDS. Numerical simulations were compared with experimental data obtained at various scales, from laboratory to field fires in grassland and in Mediterranean shrubland. Some perspectives are presented concerning the potential coupling between physical fire models with mesoscale atmospheric models to study the impacts of wildfires at larger scale. Some of the topics on wildfire physical modelling that need further research are identified in the conclusions.},

Wood spheres were pyrolyzed in a vertical tube furnace at temperatures ranging from 638 K to 879 K. Mass loss and temperatures of the sample were measured during pyrolysis. Center temperature measurements showed two distinct thermal events consisting of sequential endothermic and exothermic reactions. A numerical investigation of these endo/exothermic reactions using various pyrolysis kinetics models was conducted to determine the pyrolysis mechanism and the heats of the pyrolysis reactions. A comparison of the experimental and numerical results showed that (i) Contrary to the suggestions in the literature, the contributions of the secondary tar decomposition and lignin decomposition to the center temperature exothermic peak are small. (ii) Exothermic decomposition of the intermediate solid is responsible for the center temperature peak. (iii) The center temperature plateau is caused by the endothermic decomposition of cellulose. (iv) Internal pressure generation was found to be quite important because it controls the pyrolyzate mass transfer and thus affects both the heat transfer and the residence time of the pyrolysis gases for secondary decomposition.},

  abstract = {The laminar flamelet concept views a turbulent diffusion flame as an ensemble of laminar diffusion flamelets. Work relevant to the flamelet concept is spread over various fields in the literature: laminar flame studies, asymptotic analysis, theory of turbulence and percolation theory. This review tries to gather and integrate this material in order to derive a self-consistent formulation. Under the assumption of equal diffusivities a coordinate-free formulation of the flamelet structure is given. This assumption is relaxed and flow dependent effects are considered. It is shown that the steady laminar counterflow diffusion flame exhibits a very similar scalar structure as unsteady distorted mixing layers in a turbulent flow field. Therefore the counterflow geometry is proposed to be the most representative steady flow field to study chemistry models and molecular transport effects in laminar flamelets. The conserved scalar model is interpreted as the most basic flamelet structure. Non-equilibrium calculations are reviewed.},

The influence of sample diameter (5–20 mm), incident heat flux (60–180 kW/m2) and initial moisture content (1–50 wt\%) was studied. Char yields and temperature histories were monitored. Initial moisture content impact was highlighted. Indeed, steam coming from the sample core drying can gasify the external char layer, reducing therefore the char yield and increasing syngas production. This study was supported by a 2D unsteady numerical model of biomass degradation (mass, momentum and heat conservation coupled with Broido-Shafizadeh reaction scheme). This model gave more insight about phenomena occurring inside the degrading sample. It revealed that a pyrolysis front follows up a drying one. Therefore, steam is forced out of the sample through a high temperature char layer, making char steam gasification chemically possible.},

  abstract = {In the framework of a general research on biomass combustion, this paper presents and discusses the experimental techniques developed to analyze the heating, drying and devolatilization of biomass particles of few millimeters, a size range scarcely studied in the past. Individual particles were suspended in a stream of hot gases generated by a Flat Flame Burner, with controlled temperature and composition. The evolution of their morphology was monitored by time-lapse photography; additionally, an estimate of the instantaneous volatile release rate was derived from the picture series based on the size of the volatile shell flame. The temperature inside the particles (3–15 mm in diameter) was measured with pairs of fine wire thermocouples located at the particle's center and near its surface. The systematic error associated to this technique (deviations up to 300 K in relation to the actual particle temperature), due to the intense heat transfer along the metal wires, was evaluated experimentally and modeled; the agreement found in the comparison allowed for establishing a procedure to correct those signals and thus adequately evaluate the thermal gradients within the particles.

  abstract = {1. The equations of motion of viscous fluid (obtained by grafting on certain terms to the abstract equations of the Eulerian form so as to adapt these equations to the case of fluids subject to stresses depending in some hypothetical manner on the rates of distortion, which equations Navier seems to have first introduced in 1822, and which were much studied by Cauchy and Poisson) were finally shown by St. Venant and Sir Gabriel Stokes, in 1845, to involve no other assumption than that the stresses, other than that of pressure uniform in all directions, are linear functions of the rates of distortion, with a co-efficient depending on the physical state of the fluid. By obtaining a singular solution of these equations as applied to the case of pendulums in steady periodic motion, Sir G. Stokes was able to compare the theoretical results with the numerous experiments that had been recorded, with the result that the theoretical calculations agreed so closely with the experimental determinations as seemingly to prove the truth of the assumption involved. This was also the result of comparing the flow of water through uniform tubes with the flow calculated from a singular solution of the equations so long as the tubes were small and the velocities slow. On the other hand, these results, both theoretical and practical, were directly at variance with common experience as to the resistance encountered by larger bodies moving with higher velocities through water, or by water moving with greater velocities through larger tubes. This discrepancy Sir G. Stokes considered as probably resulting from eddies which rendered the actual motion other than that to which the singular solution referred and not as disproving the assumption.},

The method of computing atmospheric changes, which he mapped out in great detail in this book, is essentially the method used today. He was greatly ahead of his time because, before his ideas could bear fruit, advances in four critical areas were needed: better understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere; stable computational algorithms to integrate the equations; regular observations of the free atmosphere; and powerful automatic computer equipment. Over the ensuing years, progress in numerical weather prediction has been dramatic. Weather prediction and climate modelling have now reached a high level of sophistication, and are witness to the influence of Richardson's ideas.

  abstract = {In this work, tools are developed for different applications of Lagrangian particle methods in large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulation (DNS), to represent solid fuel particles, and notional gas phase particles in the Lagrangian transported filtered density function (FDF) method. In the first part of this work, the computational framework for pulverized coal combustion LES relying on Lagrangian particles is extended by the incorporation of a multidimensional flamelet model for gas phase combustion and different devolatilization models. The multidimensional flamelet model is parameterized by two mixture fractions for volatiles and char off-gases, enthalpy and scalar dissipation rate. The framework and modeling is adapted to a semi-industrial scale coal furnace and a laboratory coal jet flame to validate the simulation approach in a realistic case and to study devolatilization models in detail. The data is analyzed and extensively compared to experimental measurements, with emphasis on species and temperature predictions, burnout statistics, radiation, and devolatilization and ignition behavior. To be able to better understand the ignition process and provide a database for flamelet modeling, the code is extended for pulverized coal combustion simulation DNS. This includes the incorporation of species transport, chemical kinetics and appropriate solvers. The DNS data is analyzed in detail, focusing on the ignition behavior, burning modes, heat losses and pseudo-flamelet structures, providing valuable implications for flamelet modeling in the LES. For the second part of this work, a transported filtered density function (FDF) method is implemented into the LES code. This transported FDF method is then modified to combine cost-effective flamelet-based presumed FDF models with accurate transported FDF finite rate chemistry strategies in a hybrid manner. The hybrid method relies on seeding Lagrangian particles representing the transported FDF only at those locations of the flame where the flamelet model is insufficient, aiming to improve accuracy at an affordable cost. This hybrid method is tested on the Sydney/Sandia piloted jet flame with inhomogeneous inlets. It is shown that the method can accurately predict the flame with a greatly reduced number of computational particles.},

The model includes the flow inside and outside the porous wood log and accounts for convective, conductive and radiative heat transfer. A two-step pyrolysis reaction scheme is used to model the conversion from wood to tar, gas and char. The results of the simulations compare well with the authors experimental data which are presented in terms of radial temperature distribution and mass reduction, for both dry and wet cases. Our transient simulations provide us with the detailed flow field inside and outside the wood log. It clearly shows not only the existence but also the structure of the pyrolysis gas plumes leaving the wood. These plumes have only been visualised experimentally by few authors [Brackmann C et al. Optical and mass spectroscopy study of the pyrolysis gas of wood particles. Appl Spectros 2003;57(2):216–22, [12]] without any quantitative measurements and the present investigation gives a realistic estimation that we presently use to evaluate its impact on the heat and mass transfer, and on the momentum balance and the particle dispersion in a near future work. The gas plumes have a maximum velocity magnitude ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 m sÀ1 and vanish when all the wood gas is produced. It is shown that increasing the convective flow around the wood log do not significantly modify the pyrolysis gas plume structure and seems to have small effect on the overall heating and the pyrolysis process which are mainly controlled by the thermal radiation from the hot surrounding walls.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            An automatic method for the reduction of chemical kinetic mechanisms under specific physical or thermodynamic conditions is presented. The method relies on the genetic algorithm search logic to gradually reduce the number of reactions from the detailed mechanism while still preserving its ability to describe the overall chemistry at an acceptable error. Accuracy of the reduced mechanism is determined by comparing its solution to the solution obtained with the full mechanism under the same initial and/or physical conditions. However, not only the chemical accuracy and the size of the mechanism are considered but also the time for its solution which helps to avoid stiff and slow converging mechanisms, thus preferring the fast solutions. The reduction method is demonstrated for a detailed mechanism for methane combustion, GRI‐Mech 3.0, which was reduced from 325 reactions and 53 species to 58 reactions and 26 species, and for an iron oxide formation mechanism from iron pentacarbonyl doped flames by Wlokas et~al.

The performance of the reduced mechanisms is shown for homogeneous constant pressure reactors and for burner‐stabilized flames. The results show a good agreement between reduced and full mechanisms for both the reactor and flame cases. The presented method is flexible and can be easily adjusted to either yield more accurate (but bigger) or smaller (but less accurate) reduced mechanisms, depending on the user's preference.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            This paper describes an automatic method for the optimization of reaction rate constants of reduced reaction mechanisms. The optimization technique is based on a genetic algorithm that aims at finding new reaction rate coefficients that minimize the error introduced by the preceding reduction process. The error is defined by an objective function that covers regions of interest where the reduced mechanism may deviate from the original mechanism. The mechanism's performance is assessed for homogeneous reactor or laminar‐flame simulations against the results obtained from a given reference—the original mechanism, another detailed mechanism, or experimental data, if available. The overall objective function directs the search towards more accurate reduced mechanisms that are valid for a given set of operating conditions. An optional feature to the objective function is a penalty term that permits to minimize the change to the reaction coefficients, keeping them as close as possible to the original value. This means that the penalty function can be used to constrain the reaction rates modifications during the optimization if needed. It is demonstrated that the penalty function is successful and can be combined with predefined uncertainty bounds for each reaction of the mechanism. In addition, the penalty function can be modified to achieve a further reduction of the mechanism. The algorithm is demonstrated for the optimization of a previously reduced variant of the GRI‐Mech 3.0, a               tert               ‐butanol combustion mechanism by Sarathy et al.

Flame               , 2008, 152, 507–528), for which the complete uncertainty vector is known. The method has shown to be, robust, flexible, and suitable for a wide range of operating conditions by using multiple criteria simultaneously.},

This quantitative analysis of fire as a fluid dynamic phenomenon embedded in a highly turbulent flow is beginning to reveal the combined interactions of the vegetative structure, combustion-driven convective effects, and atmospheric boundary layer processes. This book provides an overview of the developments in modeling wildland fire dynamics and the key dynamical processes involved.

  abstract = {Fixed-bed conversion is one of the standard methods for conversion of biofuels. However, in several cases the performance observed in applications of fixed-bed conversion of biomass and waste is far from optimal. Mathematical modeling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has a large potential to assist in the optimization of the fuel conversion processes, with regard to parameters such as burnout, emissions, fuel flexibility and material wear. To this end, computationally efficient models that can handle the most important features of the fuel conversion processes are needed.},

  abstract = {The e ective thermal conductivity is one of the most important parameters for modelling of thermo-chemical conversion of wood. It changes both with temperature and with conversion of the wood. There have been suggestions on modelling of this problem, together with measurements, in earlier works, especially for wet and dry wood, but for char the knowledge is poor. Here, two principle models of e ective thermal conductivity on the basis of the pore structure in wood are validated by a comparison with direct numerical simulation of the ÿbre structure. The validation leads to a more general model, both for conductivity in the perpendicular and parallel directions relative to the ÿbres in the wood. In addition, the model expresses the e ective thermal conductivity of char, since the wood material maintains its ÿbre structure during conversion. The e ective thermal conductivity is estimated from given values of temperature, density and moisture content of the wood. It can also be applied to pellets and chipboards. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The model is based on kinetic models considering the thermal degradation during the pyrolysis phase and the evolution of the physicomechanical properties as functions of temperature. The numerical model is integrated into Abaqus via user subroutines (Umat and Umatht) and applied to the analysis of the fire behaviour of panels made of flax chipboards. Thermogravimetric tests are performed on flax particles to serve for the identification of the kinetic parameters of the pyrolysis models. Once these kinetic parameters are determined, they are integrated into a complete numerical model to simulate the behaviour under fire of flax chipboards on small and large scales. The obtained trends in the predicted values indicate good agreements when compared to the measured values. The simu­ lations show that the numerical model is capable of accurately modelling the thermomechanical transfers taking place within the material during exposure to fire.},

Analysis of data for heat transfer in randomly packed beds and compact (void fraction less than 0.65) staggered tube bundles indicates that the Nusselt number for a wide range of packing materials and tube arrangements is given by                              provided                                N                 Re                              ≥ 50. The correlations presented in this paper are not necessarily the most accurate available; however, they have wide application, are easy to use, and are quite satisfactory for most design calculations.},

Optimization of thermal efficiency and furnace emissions is an important goal, which requires accurate understanding of all physical and chemical effects in the reactor. A combined transient single particle and fuel‐bed model is presented. The fuel‐bed model is discretized, and a representative particle is chosen and discretized in a radial direction at each grid point. Mass, momentum and energy balances are solved for the entire system. Drying is modeled using an equilibrium approach, and primary pyrolysis is described by independent parallel‐reactions. Secondary tar cracking, homogeneous gas reactions, and heterogeneous char reactions are modeled using kinetic data from literature. Simulations validated for single particles agree well with experimental studies. Simulation results for the combustion of a biomass bed are presented for one set of furnace conditions.},

  abstract = {The general objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of advanced combustion and radiation models for large eddy simulations (LES) of fires. We adopt here an unsteady laminar flamelet model that includes: detailed information on combustion chemistry through a tabulated chemistry approach; a careful description of the combustion-radiation coupling (local radiation phenomena are treated by the flamelet solver while non-local radiation phenomena are treated by the LES solver through the radiative transfer equation); a description of subgrid-scale turbulence-radiation interactions; and a description of non-grey radiation effects (through a Weighted-Sum-of-Grey-Gases – WSGG model). The new flamelet-based combustion/radiation model is incor­ porated into the LES solver FireFOAM and is evaluated by comparisons with experimental data obtained in a turbulent line burner experiment previously studied at the University of Maryland. Comparisons between simulated and measured temperatures show relatively good agreement (and significant improvements compared to our previous work). In addition, comparisons between simulated and measured values of the global radiant fraction show that provided that the WSGG option is used, the flamelet model is capable of simulating changes in the flame radiative emissions that result from changes in the oxygen strength of the coflow.},

  abstract = {In this work, an efficient three-dimensional pyrolysis model for large biomass particles with arbitrary shapes has been developed based on the composed-sphere concept and the Voronoi tessellation. The shrinkage of the parent particle is realized by the active and passive translations of each composed sub-sphere. Moreover, the radical Voronoi tessellation can help resolve the heat transfer between sub-spheres and the porosity inside the particle. Meanwhile, the anisotropies of heat transfer and particle shrinkage are solved by adopting the orientation-related thermal conductivity and shrinking factors. To comprehensively validate the model, six different particles and pyrolysis processes (i.e., two uniformly shrunk spherical particles, a non-uniformly shrunk cylindrical particle, a non-uniformly heated cubic particle, and two non-regular shaped particles) are simulated. The simulation results agree well with the available experimental data. In addition, the sensitivity analyses of three different parameters (i.e., shrinking threshold, thermal conductivity, and shrinking factor) are also conducted. The developed model can not only well characterize different-shaped particles but also provide more intra-particle details during the pyrolysis of large biomass particles.},

  abstract = {Forest fires can be classified into two regimes, depending on Byram convective number NC: a plume-dominated and wind-driven regime. This classification is often based on two-dimensional (2D) studies without considering flame front structures, and is associated with the change of governing heat transfer mechanism. Studies based on three-dimensional (3D) considerations suggest the dependency of the fire regime transition on canopy charac­ teristics CdLAI (CdαsσsHF=2) through which the atmosphere boundary layer (ABL) flow changes to mixing layer (ML) flow. Hence, the primary objective of the present study is to investigate the fire regime transition and its associated heat transfer mechanisms with the aid of drawing a dimensionless configuration space \{NC, CdLAI\}. This requires an objective definition of the Byram convective number; the 2 m or 10 m high open wind speed (U∞ ¼ U2 or U10) often used to define it being arbitrary. Therefore, the present study introduces a scaling method for the reference height (Yref ) at which the wind speed Uref is chosen to define a new Byram convective number NC’. A mathematical expression for Yref as a function of canopy/vegetation height is proposed for a small-scale, stationary fire. The new configuration space \{NC’, CdLAI\} is considered more suitable for investigating the fire regime transition.},
