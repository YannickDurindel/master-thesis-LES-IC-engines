I hereby solemnly declare that I have independently completed this work or, in the case of
group work, the part of the work that I have marked accordingly. I have not made use of the
unauthorised assistance of third parties. Furthermore, I have used only the stated sources or
aids and I have referenced all statements (particularly quotations) that I have adopted from the
sources I have used verbatim or in essence.

I declare that the version of the work I have submitted in digital form is identical to the printed
copies submitted.

I am aware that, in the case of an examination offence, the relevant assessment will be marked
as 'insufficient' (5.0). In addition, an examination offence may be punishable as an administra-
tive offence (Ordnungswidrigkeit) with a fine of up to \euro 50,000. In cases of multiple or otherwise
serious examination offences, I may also be removed from the register of students.

I am aware that the examiner and/or the Examination Board may use relevant software or
other electronic aids in order to establish an examination offence has occurred.

I solemnly declare that I have made the previous statements to the best of my knowledge and
belief and that these statements are true and I have not concealed anything.

I am aware of the potential punishments for a false declaration in lieu of oath and in particular
of the penalties set out in Sections 156 and 161 of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch; StGB), which I have been specifically referred to.
